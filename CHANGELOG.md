# Changelog

## 0.25.2

- Adds an API for downstream extensions that want to interact with `ide-purescript.` More information can be found in README.md.

## 0.25.1

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.4`

- Auto build of opened files is now behind a setting `purescript.buildOpenedFiles` and defaulted to `false`, this should be 
  considered experimental for the time being. There are 2 issues which become more likely to be triggered by this feature,
  firstly rebuilding (even unchanged) files can cause downstream modules to require rebuilding in an incremental build ([issue](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/4066)) and secondly there are reports that fast-rebuilding a file during a full/incremental build can cause corrupt output.

- Formatting provider selection: Now `purescript.formatter` can be set to `purty` (the previous formatter and still the default),
  `purs-tidy` or `pose`. Requires these tools to be already installed

- Internal changes that could avoid a case of the language server crashing abruptly

## 0.25.0

* Updates from `purescript-language-server` version `0.15.2`

- The code action with kind `source.organizeImports` is now the action which applies all compiler suggestions
  for unused imports, `source.sortImports` is added (previously "Organize imports") to align with the changes for JS/TS
  languages in vscode 1.57. This can be used with `editor.codeActionsOnSave` or key-bound with `editor.action.sourceAction`.
- Show a warning dialog (with build option) on start if we get an externs out of date error
- Remove deprecated editor mode/polling purs ide config (Removed in 0.13.8)

* Multi-root workspace support

  This is basic support via launching multiple language server instances. Should launch an instance whenever a file is opened under a particular workspace root folder, and stop an instance only when removing the folder from the workspace.

  Tested for basic interaction but may run into issues for less file-based commands on additional workspaces?
